What is Encapsulation? 

Encapsulation means hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods. 

This provides a controlled interface and protects the object from unintended interference and misuse.

How Encapsulation is done in Python? 
Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like private, protected, and public in languages like Java or C++. But it provides conventions and name mangling to simulate them.

Visibility	        Syntax	        Accessible From
Public	            var	            Anywhere
Protected	        _var	        Class & Subclass (by convention)
Private	            __var	        Only within the class (name mangled)
